# Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the Iris dataset to distinguish between different types of iris flowers based on their features. The dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It can be found in various libraries and datasets repositories. For this project, the dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Analysis and Visualization
1. Data Exploration: The dataset is explored to understand its structure and contents.
2. Data Processing: Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied if necessary.
3. Visualization: Various graphs and plots are generated using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the relationships between different features and the distribution of the iris species.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vijay7425/Iris-Data-Analysis.git
   cd iris-dataset-analysis
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook IrisAnalysis.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset.

## Results
The analysis and visualization of the Iris dataset provide insights into the distinguishing features of the three iris species. The project demonstrates the use of data analysis and visualization techniques to understand and interpret complex datasets.

Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with different visualizations to gain further insights into the Iris dataset!
